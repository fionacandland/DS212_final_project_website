Museums, especially those with free and reduced admission fees, can cut across social barriers to accessing art, such as socioeconomic status and systemic inequality, and connect people of all ages to cultures, ideas, and images that can broaden one’s worldview. In turn, this contributes to building a world where we all understand each other just a little bit better. However, despite the potential of museums to be sites of access and education, they are also sites of social harm. Museum conditions and practices are inequitable for staff, visitors, and the artists whose work these institutions choose not to display. Offering a glimpse into the inequity within museum staffing is Max Hollein, who currently presides as the director of the Metropolitan (Met) Museum of Art in New York City. Hollein is the Met’s 10th consecutive white male director (Sayej). Further, more than 25% of art museum workers report having experienced discrimination at their current institutions, and discrimination is twice as likely for an art museum worker with a disability (“Findings”). Regarding race and ethnic groups, discrimination is particularly high for Native American/ Alaska Native workers at 39% compared to only 24% of white workers reporting that they have experienced discrimination (“Findings”).\nRegarding museum visitors, there is growing discourse about the ways in which art museums overlook a demographic who has historically “been the sector’s biggest donors” : older people (Kennedy and Szántó). From the small print on wall labels, to uncomfortable gallery seating, to heavy doors at museum entrances, ageism is widespread in the sector (the art newspaper). Further evidence of this trend is found in the distribution of museum funding across different age demographics, 75% of the 2 billion dollars U.S. museums spend on education initiatives annually is devoted to programs for people under the age of 18, and the remaining 15% is for those older than 18 (Kennedy and Szántó). While educating the nation’s youth should be a priority for all, the neglect of the aging community can not be ignored.Finally, art museums also perpetuate inequity through their selections of the type of art and the artists they choose to include in exhibits. Female identifying and Black American artists are grossly underrepresented. For example, research across 31 museums in the U.S. demonstrates that works by female artists compose only 11% of all acquisitions, and Black American artists across all genders account only for 6.3% of all exhibitions (McGivern).\nAs we consider the current and future state of art museums and their commitments to fighting inequity, we must also consider the impact that broader social events have had on the trajectory of these institutions. Two recent events, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and murder of George Floyd, have had global impact and touched the art museum sector in different yet substantial ways. With the loss of revenue from ticket sales and event space rentals, some museums have had to cope with significant budget cuts. The Portland Art Museum cut its budget by 40% in 2020 and laid off a significant portion of its employees, changes whose impacts are still felt today (Notarianni). Additionally, Black Lives Matter protests in 2020 following the murder of George Floyd led to some museums taking a public stance on racial equality and commitment to incorporating Black art into their collections (Lynch 1). However, only time will tell if these commitments to racial equality will be delivered and what the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic will be on the art museum sector."

    "text": "PCA Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo initially explore the structure and similarities among variables and responders, we turned to unsupervised learning techniques popular in statistical modeling: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering. We chose Dimension Reduction techniques because of the large number of survey questions we had. These techniques are excellent at identifying patterns and important features in large datasets. The goal of these preliminary plots was to understand patterns in responses and the overall influence of different survey questions in creating such patterns. Our findings would then inform which variables we decided to take a closer look at and patterns to look for between variable responses. First, we performed principal component analysis on our 2022 data, which essentially transforms the original survey data into a set of new summary variables that contain the main points of the data. These summary variables are called principal components, as you’ll notice on the x and y axis labels of the plot."

    "text": "Survey Question Loading Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis loading plot shows the top 20 most influential variables in defining the clusters above. The longer and darker the arrows are, the more influence they have on the overall structure of the data. The information in these plots tells you a lot! First, it shows us the 20 most influential questions and, within those 20, the greatest contributors to the clustering patterns. Second, it shows the correlation between questions. If arrows, which represent each question, are pointing in the same direction, then they are positively correlated; if they are pointing in opposite directions, then they are negatively correlated; and if they are at a right angle from one another, they are uncorrelated.\nLooking at the loading plot, one can see that question 6_2 is perhaps the most prominent question in this 2022 survey, while others like 8_9 and 8_11 also played a large role. What is also quite revealing about this plot is that questions are either heavily correlated with one another or completely uncorrelated. The question grouping is also intriguing. For example, not only are all of the 8_ questions included in this top 20 PCA graph, but all of them are clustered together, too. This tells us that people answered the 8_ questions similarly depending on their cluster. The same rhetoric applies to the 5_ questions.\nAdditionally, how people answered the 8_ questions did not affect how they chose to answer the 5 questions. Each family tends to follow a specific theme, like art pieces displayed, diversity of staff, payment of staff, and community inclusion, among others. Understanding these question families and what the root of their questioning reveals is incredibly important in understanding the priorities of museums and what sentiments they would like to promote and dismiss in their institutions. Depending on specific answers, we can understand how the display of art works connects to community inclusion, diversity of staff, and so on."

    "text": "Pictured: NADAC logo, the collectors and organizers for the survey project and source for both of our datasets.\n\n\n\nAquisition\nWe aquired both of our datasets from the National Archive of Data on Arts & Culture. All of the data is free to access online through the NADAC website. The particular project was funded by the Mellon Foundation.\n\n\nCleaning\nIn order to get our data ready to explore and analyze, we had to do some preliminary cleaning. This consisted of screening the questions and identifying which ones had a match between the two years, and which questions were excluded from one of the years. Additionally, in our preliminary cleaning phase, we took out many demographic and identifying variables like questions about responder identity and the institution’s characteristics because they were masked by the ICPSR. We would have loved to include these demographic indicators, however, the information was not available to us, so we decided to remove those variables as the contents were meaningless. We also decided to take out the questions without a match as our research was aimed towards change over time. Getting into the more computational cleaning, we computed the NA rate on each column. If a column had greater than 10% NAs, we removed it and its counterpart from the other dataset. While we do think the abundant missingness in our datasets was interesting, we had over 100 questions to analyze and felt that removing these questions would not leave our datasets colorless or our findings less compelling. This decision was primarily driven by the consistency and cleanliness of the dataset.\n\n\nWrangling\nAfter removing the columns with greater than 10% NA, we looked through each row, which represents each response, and calculated their responses throughout the survey. If the responder answered less than 50% of the survey questions, we removed them from the data set, inferring that they had put little effort into the response, and therefore, the few responses that they gave may not be representative of their beliefs. For the people who responded to more than 50% of the questions, we converted their NAs to No Answer to reflect a conscious decision not to answer the specific question, for whatever reason. We made these decisions based on the volume of NAs in the dataset, hoping to reflect the randomness and deliberation of missingness in a structured, clear way. Our last step in cleaning the data was releveling the response factors. The 2020 survey was recorded with string responses like “High Priority” or “Very Low Priority”, while the 2022 responses were recorded with integers, 1 representing “Very High Priority”, and the higher numbers representing a decrease in priority. Because of this inconsistency, we had to go through the 2022 dataset and relevel the integers to reflect spring responses both for clarity and consistency."
